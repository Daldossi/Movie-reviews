# Movie-reviews

A sentiment analysis is a case of text classification in which the goal is to predict the emotional state of the writers of text messages. 
So, it is a classification problem, where the classes are the authorsâ€™ emotions (angry, delighted, sad, happy, disgusted... ).
The aim of my project is to implement a sentiment analysis trhough a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier in order to analyze 
the movie reviews written by the users of the IMDB website (www.imdb.com); in particular I will predict the polarity of the reviews 
distinguishing the positive comments (class 1) from the negative ones (class 0).
