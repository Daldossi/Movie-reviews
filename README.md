# Movie-reviews

This is a sentiment analysis, that is a case of text classification in which we intend to predict the emotional state of the writers of text messages. 
So, it is a classification problem, where the classes are the authorsâ€™ emotions (angry, delighted, sad, happy, disgusted... ).
My aim is to implement of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier that analyzes the movie reviews written by the users of the IMDB website (www.imdb.com);
in pticular we will predict the polarity of the reviews distinguishing the positive comments (class 1) from the negative ones (class 0).
